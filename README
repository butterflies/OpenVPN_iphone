This is a source repo for OpenVPN patched to work on the iPhone.

Right now this is *just* a patch. I will add to it later.

My patch is based on Friedrich Schoeller's work found at http://code.gerade.org/tunemu/

All I've done, is make the autoconf magic work.


YMMV... no promises and all that stuff.


Roughly, heres what you do to get it to build:

- get your dependencies in order... you'll need openssl, libpcap, maybe lzo if you use that.
- download openvpn_2.1rc19 from openvpn.net
- unpack
- apply openvpn_tunemu.diff
- configure
- make

You should end up with an openvpn binary.

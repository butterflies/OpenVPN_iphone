This is a source repo for OpenVPN patched to work on the iPhone.

Right now this is *just* a patch. I will add to it later.

My patch is based on Friedrich Schoeller's work found at http://code.gerade.org/tunemu/

This version tries to play nicer with the original OpenVPN code. It should still build
a non iphone binary, but this is not tested.

Changelog:
- no longer necessary to use --enable-tunemu with configure


YMMV... no promises and all that stuff.


Roughly, heres what you do to get it to build:

- get your dependencies in order... you'll need openssl, libpcap, maybe lzo if you use that.
- download openvpn_2.1rc20 from openvpn.net
- unpack
- apply openvpn_tunemu.diff
- configure
- make

You should end up with an openvpn binary. You'll want to strip it and run ldid -S against it.

Here's *my* configure line... yours will likely vary slightly....

  $ ./configure --host=arm-apple-darwin9 --disable-server --disable-pkcs11 \
--disable-http --disable-port-share --disable-plugins --disable-socks \
--with-lzo-headers=../../lzo/lzo-2.03/include/ --with-lzo-lib=../../lzo/lzo-2.03/src/.libs/ \
--with-ssl-headers=../../openssl/include/ --with-ssl-lib=../../openssl/lib/ \
--with-pcap-headers=../../pcap/include/ --with-pcap-lib=../../pcap/lib/
